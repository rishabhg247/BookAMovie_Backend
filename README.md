This is the Server side code of my full stack project named Book-A-Movie which is given to us as Capston project by Almabetter. 
In this project i have made api's in ExpressJs to Post and Get movie details for my Client(Book-A-Movie). I have used MongoDb as a Database to store my Data.

This API is live on : https://book-a-movie-backend.vercel.app/api/booking  
This API has 3 methods..  
1- GET- To get the last Booked Movie details.  
2- POST- To Submit the Selected Movie details which will be stored in MongoDb Database.  
3- DELETE- To remove all previous Booking Details.  

 
How to use this Node Server

Clone the code from github and run npm install.  
To create database please install mongodb in local machine  
Now run index.js this will Start the Server or do npm start.
